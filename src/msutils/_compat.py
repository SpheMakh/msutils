"""Backwards-compatible :func:`summary`, reimplemented on top of :func:`msinfo`.

``summary()`` returned an unstructured dict of ALL-CAPS keys that mixed raw
subtable dumps with derived values. It is deprecated in favour of
:func:`msutils.msinfo`, which returns a typed, addressable
:class:`~msutils.info.MSInfo`.

This adapter keeps the old *shape* so existing pipelines keep running, but it
is built on the new reader, so several values are now **correct where they
previously were not**:

* ``FIELD.INTENTS`` is now a per-field list of intent lists, resolved through
  ``STATE_ID``. It used to be the raw ``STATE::OBS_MODE`` column, which only
  lined up with the fields by coincidence.
* ``FIELD.PERIOD`` and ``SCAN`` durations now include the final integration.
  They used to be ``max(TIME) - min(TIME)``, understating every scan by one
  integration (and reporting 0 for single-timestamp scans).
* ``MAXBL`` is now the longest baseline over all three UVW components. It used
  to use only *u* and *v*, making it a projected *uv* distance.
* ``EXPOSURE`` is now the shortest integration time present, rather than
  whatever row 0 happened to hold. Like ``STATE_ID`` below, the legacy dict has
  room for exactly one scalar here, so an MS with mixed integration times
  cannot be represented faithfully -- :func:`msutils.msinfo` exposes the full
  set as ``MSInfo.integration_times``.

Code that depended on the old (wrong) numbers should move to
:func:`msutils.msinfo`.
