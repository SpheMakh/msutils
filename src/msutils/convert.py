"""Convert MSv2 Measurement Sets to MSv4 processing sets.

A thin wrapper over :func:`xradio.measurement_set.convert_msv2_to_processing_set`
-- xradio owns the conversion, this owns the ergonomics: argument validation,
overwrite handling, and returning an :class:`~msutils.info.MSInfo` for the
result so the output can be inspected with the same code as the input.

Needs the ``convert`` extra (``pip install 'msutils[convert]'``). Note that
*reading* an MSv4 set needs only ``msutils[msv4]`` (xarray + zarr); xradio is
required for writing one.
