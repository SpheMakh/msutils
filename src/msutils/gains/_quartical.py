"""Reading and writing QuartiCal gain stores.

A store is a zarr group per term, holding one dataset per chunk the solve
was cut into::

    <store>.qc/
      G/
        G_0/    gains (gain_time, gain_freq, antenna, direction, correlation)
                gain_flags (gain_time, gain_freq, antenna, direction)
                attrs: FIELD_ID, DATA_DESC_ID, FIELD_NAME, NAME, TYPE
        G_1/    ...
      K/
        K_0/    ...

which is nearly the model's shape, so reading is a rename of axes rather
than a fold. Four details that are not obvious from the arrays alone, each
of which the model has to undo:

* **a field is spread over several datasets.** `G_0` and `G_1` can both
  carry `FIELD_ID: 0`, differing only in the times they cover -- QuartiCal
  chunks its solve, normally per scan. So (field, ddid) does not identify a
  dataset, and reading them separately would make a "block" a chunk rather
  than a field's solution: an operation asking for a two-hour window would
  silently get whatever one scan held. They are concatenated in time on the
  way in and split back on the way out (`GainBlock.chunks`).
* **flags carry no correlation axis.** QuartiCal flags a solution, not a
  correlation of one, so the flag array is broadcast across correlations on
  the way in and collapsed with `any` on the way out.
* **most terms are parameterised**, including `amplitude` and `phase`. The
  `gains` array is not the authoritative one for them: QuartiCal reads
  `params` back and rebuilds the gains from it, so both are carried through
  the model and both are written. What an *operation* can do with a given
  parameterisation is a separate question, answered by
  `msutils.gains._params` from the parameters' own names.
* **a store holds several terms**, unlike a caltable which holds one. So
  `read_quartical` takes a term, defaulting to the only one when the store
  holds one and refusing to guess when it holds more.

xarray and zarr are an optional extra (``msutils[gains]``): imported inside
the functions, never at module scope, so ``import msutils`` stays free of
them (``tests/test_import.py`` enforces that for the package as a whole).
