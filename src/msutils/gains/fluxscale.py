"""Bootstrap a flux-density scale from one calibrator's gains onto another's.

The physics is one assumption: **the antenna gains are the same, on
average, for both calibrators**. They are observed minutes apart through
the same instrument, so whatever differs between their solutions is the
sky, not the receiver.

That is exploited by solving the two deliberately differently. The
reference is solved against a model with its true flux density, so its
gains come out purely instrumental. The transfer calibrator's flux is
unknown, so it is solved against an assumed model -- conventionally a 1 Jy
point source -- and the solver, having nowhere else to put the discrepancy,
absorbs it into the gain amplitudes::

    |g_transfer| = |g_instrumental| * sqrt(S_true / S_assumed)

So the flux falls out of a ratio, per antenna and correlation, of the
median gain amplitude::

    S = (median|g_transfer| / median|g_reference|)^2 * S_reference

and the *scatter* of that ratio across antennas is the uncertainty. The
transfer gains are then divided by ``sqrt(S)`` so they too become
instrumental, which is what makes them applicable to a target.

## What this does that CASA's `fluxscale` does not

* **Two tables, not one.** CASA compares fields *within* a single caltable,
  which forces a caller to solve the second calibrator by appending into a
  copy of the first one's table. Here the reference and the transfer are
  separate inputs (the same path twice is still allowed, for a table that
  does hold both).
* **The number is a value, not a log line.** `fluxscale()` returns a
  :class:`FluxscaleResult`; the CLI can write it as JSON. CASA writes the
  fit to a `listfile` if asked and to its logger otherwise, and a pipeline
  that discards the logger discards the only record of the measurement.
* **The output holds the transfer field alone.** CASA's fluxtable carries
  the reference calibrator's solutions through as well, so applying it
  without naming a field corrects with a blend of two calibrators.
* **Antennas are matched by name**, not by position, so two tables that
  disagree on antenna ordering produce an error rather than a wrong number.

It is deliberately *not* a re-implementation of everything CASA's task
does: there is no spectral fit across spectral windows yet (each window is
reported on its own), and no incremental mode.
