"""Divide a scale out of a set of gains, leaving their shape behind.

A calibration chain solves several terms against the same data, and where
the overall amplitude scale ends up among them is not physics -- it is an
artefact of how the solver was run. CASA's sequential chain leaves a
bandpass with a mean amplitude of essentially exactly 1 because `B` is
solved *after* `G` and is therefore a residual; QuartiCal solves the chain
jointly and makes no such promise, so the flat part of the amplitude can sit
in either term. Both are self-consistent as long as every term is applied
together, and both are wrong the moment a caller takes one term out of the
set -- transfers a bandpass to another observation, say, or seeds a chain
with a subset of another chain's products.

Normalising makes that explicit: the scale goes where you say it goes,
rather than where the solver happened to leave it.

## The three choices, and why each is a choice

**What to average** (`statistic`) -- `median` or `mean`. Shared with
`fluxscale` (see `msutils.gains._stats`); the median resists a bad scan and
is the default, the mean is what CASA's `solnorm` computes.

**Over which axes** (`axis`) -- `freq` normalises each solution's spectrum
to unit amplitude and keeps its time variation, which is bandpass
normalisation; `time` does the reverse; `all` (the default) takes out one
number per solution set, leaving both structures intact.

**Over what scope** (`scope`) -- and this is the one with teeth:

* `antenna` (default) gives every (antenna, correlation) its own factor.
  This is CASA `solnorm`'s behaviour, and it does **not** preserve the
  relative amplitudes between antennas: those move wholesale into whatever
  term is applied alongside. That is exactly right for separating a
  bandpass's shape from a gain's scale, and exactly wrong if you meant to
  take out only an overall scale.
* `block` uses one factor for the whole block, preserving every relative
  amplitude -- between antennas, between correlations -- and removing only
  the overall level. This is the one to use when moving a flux scale
  between terms.
* `correlation` sits between them: one factor per correlation, so relative
  antenna amplitudes survive but the two polarisations are levelled
  independently.

Phases are never touched. A normalisation divides by a positive real
number, so what changes is amplitude alone; nothing here re-references
phase to an antenna, which is a different operation with a different name.

For a **parameterised** term the parameters are what QuartiCal reads back,
so they are what gets divided -- and only when they are amplitudes. A
delay or phase parameterisation describes a gain of unit modulus, where
normalising is not unsupported but meaningless (see
`msutils.gains._params`).
