"""Smooth gain solutions in time and/or frequency.

Solutions from short scans or weak calibrators are noisy, and that noise is
transferred wholesale onto the target when they are applied. Smoothing
trades resolution for signal -- but only if it is done on the right
quantity, and the obvious way is wrong.

## Why the complex gain, and why renormalise

**Phase cannot be filtered directly.** It is defined modulo 2*pi, so a
running mean over a solution set that crosses +/-pi averages values that are
adjacent on the circle and far apart as numbers, and produces a spike at
every wrap. Unwrapping first only moves the problem: an unwrap decision on
noisy solutions is itself unreliable, and one wrong branch propagates
through everything after it.

Filtering the **complex** gain has no such failure: adjacent phases are
adjacent vectors whatever their numerical values, so the wrap simply is not
represented.

**But vector averaging shrinks the amplitude.** Averaging unit vectors
pointing in different directions gives something shorter than unit length --
the faster the phase varies, the more amplitude a complex filter destroys.
Left uncorrected, smoothing a rapidly-rotating gain would quietly rescale
the flux of everything it is applied to.

So this smooths the complex gain for its *phase* and the amplitude
separately for its *magnitude*, and puts them back together::

    g_smooth = (conv(g) / |conv(g)|) * conv(|g|)

which is what "smooth the complex gain and renormalise" means in practice:
the direction comes from the vector average, and the length is restored from
a filter that never had a wrap to trip over.

## Flags, and gaps

Every convolution here is **normalised**: flagged samples contribute
nothing, and each output is divided by the weight that actually reached it.
That handles the edges of the axis and holes in the middle identically, with
no special cases and no zeros leaking in from beyond the data.

By default the flags survive the operation -- a flagged solution stays
flagged, however many neighbours it now has. `fill=True` unflags anything
whose window contained real data, which is the general form of CASA's
`fillgaps`: use it when the flagged solutions are gaps to be bridged rather
than data to be avoided.

## Parameterised terms

A CASA `K` table stores delays as real parameters, not phasors. There the
complex/renormalise dance would be meaningless, so `param_type == "float"`
smooths the values directly -- same normalised convolution, no phase, no
renormalisation.

A QuartiCal parameterised term is the same idea with more structure: the
solution is a set of named parameters (`delay_XX`, `phase_offset_YY`,
`amplitude_XX`) on their own frequency grid, and QuartiCal reads *those*
back rather than the gains. So they are what gets filtered -- each on its
own terms: a parameter named as a phase goes through the complex plane for
the same wrap reason as above, and everything else is filtered directly.

The gains array is then rebuilt from the smoothed parameters where that is
unambiguous (an amplitude *is* the gain; a phase is its argument) and the
write is **refused** where it is not. A delay's reconstruction needs the
reference frequency the solver used, and getting it wrong is invisible in
the array while adding a per-antenna constant phase to everything the term
corrects.
